Build the module in the usual way:

Unpack the distribution, cd into the
PDL-NiceSlice-XXX directory and start
the build process:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install

You probably want to merge the contents of local.perldlrc
into your default startup file ~/.perldlrc (~ means your home
directory). A simple text editor should allow you to do that.
Read the docs to find out what the code in local.perldlrc
will allow you to do.

*NOTE*: PDL::NiceSlice relies on several modules from CPAN that make
source filtering and parsing easier. In particular it requires
the Filter distribution and Text::Balanced. To make your life easier it is
recommended that you use the CPAN module to resolve dependencies during
installation automatically.

Using the cpan installation shell installing PDL::NiceSlice should
be as easy as

   $ perl -MCPAN -e shell
   cpan> install PDL::NiceSlice
