A source filter for PDL -- take the pain out of slicing !

Perl source filtering is a way to experiment with new syntax
and the power is only limited by the sophistication of the
source parser.

Build the module in the usual way:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make test
  make install

The module is still somewhat experimental but is rapidly
stabilizing and now distributed with the PDL distribution.
